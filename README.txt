This repository contains files for the Get familiar with Three.js assignment.

The code for this assignment has been modified from the "lights" program.
This program displays a geocentric model by animating a light source (sunlight)
and 2 colored spheres (sun and moon) orbiting around a larger colored sphere (Earth).

----------

What I don't think I understand yet is how lights work. Seeing that the point light is placed on the opposite end of the
Earth object from the moon object, I found it surprising that the moon object also was also lit. I was also perplexed by the
fact that the sun object wasn't lit even though it's in the same position as the light source.
